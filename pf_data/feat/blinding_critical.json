The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM's discretion). Blindness can be cured by <i>heal</i>, <i>regeneration</i>, <i>remove blindness</i>, or similar abilities.</p>",
