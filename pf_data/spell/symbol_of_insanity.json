    "body": "<p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that all creatures within the radius of the <i>symbol of insanity </i>instead become permanently insane (as the <i>insanity </i>spell).</p><p>Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, symbol of insanity has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <i>symbol of insanity </i>simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Note</i>Magic traps such as <i>symbol of insanity </i>are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of insanity</i>.</p>",
