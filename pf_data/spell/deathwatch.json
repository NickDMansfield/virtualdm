You instantly know whether each creature within the area is dead, fragile (alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), healthy, undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct). <i>Deathwatch</i> sees through any spell or ability that allows creatures to feign death.</p>",
