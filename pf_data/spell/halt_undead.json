    "body": "<p>This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of <i>hold person</i> on a living creature). The effect is broken if the <i>halted</i> creatures are attacked or take damage.</p>",
