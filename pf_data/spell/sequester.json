The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by <i>sequester</i> become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.</p><p><i>Note</i>: The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being <i>sequestered</i>. There is no save to see the <i>sequestered</i> creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.</p>",
