If you are of good alignment, and the strongest undead aura's strength is overwhelming (see below), and the creature has HD of at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.</p><p><i>3rd Round</i>: The strength and location of each undead aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.</p><p><i>Aura Strength</i>: The strength of an undead aura is determined by the HD of the undead creature, as given on the table below.</p><p><i>Lingering Aura</i>: An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed. If <i>detect undead</i> is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power, as given on the table below.</p>",
