    "body": "<p>A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become <i>confused</i>. This abjuration has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <i>protection from law</i>, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.</p><p>Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection from law</i> does.</p><p>Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is <i>confused</i> for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the <i>confusion</i> spell, but against the save DC of <i>cloak of chaos</i>).</p>",
