    "body": "<p><i>Knock</i> opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to <i>hold portal</i> or <i>arcane lock</i>. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, <i>knock</i> opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an <i>arcane locked</i> door, the spell does not remove the <i>arcane lock</i> but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. <i>Knock</i> does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access. </p>",
