    "body": "<p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that each creature within the radius of a <i>symbol of pain </i>instead suffers wracking pains that impose a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.</p><p>Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of pain </i>has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <i>symbol of pain </i>simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Note</i>Magic traps such as <i>symbol of pain </i>are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for <i>symbol of pain</i>.</p>",
