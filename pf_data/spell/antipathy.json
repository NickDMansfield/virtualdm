The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.</p><p>Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.</p><p>A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.</p><p><i>Antipathy</i> counters and dispels <i>sympathy</i>.</p>",
