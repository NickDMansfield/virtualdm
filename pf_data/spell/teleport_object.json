    "body": "<p>This spell functions like <i>teleport</i>, except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.</p><p>If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.</p>",
