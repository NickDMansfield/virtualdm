    "body": "<p>You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the <i>phantasmal killer</i>. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.</p><p>If the subject of a <i>phantasmal killer</i> attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a <i>helm of telepathy</i>, the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.</p>",
