    "body": "<p>Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast.</p><p><i>Prepare</i>: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally.</p><p><i>Retain</i>: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the <i>mnemonic enhancer</i>. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.</p><p>In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).</p>",
