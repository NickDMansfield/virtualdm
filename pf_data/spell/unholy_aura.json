This abjuration has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of <i>protection from good</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures.</p><p>Second, a warded creature gains SR 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects the subjects from possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection from good</i> does.</p><p>Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (Fortitude negates).</p>",
