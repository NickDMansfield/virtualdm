If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.</p><p><i>Lingering Aura</i>: An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If <i>detect evil</i> is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:</p>",
