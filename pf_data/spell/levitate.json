    "body": "<p><i>Levitate</i> allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated<i></i>, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).</p><p>A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls, the second &ndash;2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of &ndash;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &ndash;1.</p>",
