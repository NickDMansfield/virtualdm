    "body": "<p>You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the <i>sending</i>, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the <i>sending</i> is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.</p><p>If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the <i>sending</i> does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)</p>",
