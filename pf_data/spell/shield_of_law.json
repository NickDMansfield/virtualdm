    "body": "<p>A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and <i>slowing</i> chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <i>protection from chaos</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.</p><p>Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection from chaos</i> does.</p><p>Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is <i>slowed</i> (Will save negates, as the <i>slow</i> spell, but against <i>shield of law</i>'s save DC).</p>",
