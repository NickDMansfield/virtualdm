    "body": "<p>The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as <i>detect evil, locate creature, scry</i>, and<i> see invisible</i>). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. <i>Mind blank</i> even foils <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, and <i>wish</i> spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as <i>arcane eye</i>, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.</p>",
