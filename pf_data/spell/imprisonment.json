    "body": "<p>When you cast <i>imprisonment</i> and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the <i>temporal stasis</i> spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a <i>freedom</i> spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a <i>crystal ball</i>, a <i>locate object</i> spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but <i>discern location</i> does. A <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a &ndash;4 penalty on its save.</p>",
