    "body": "<p>Similar to <i>augury</i> but more powerful, a <i>divination</i> spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct <i>divination</i> is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.</p><p>As with <i>augury</i>, multiple <i>divinations</i> about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first <i>divination</i> spell and yield the same answer each time.</p>",
