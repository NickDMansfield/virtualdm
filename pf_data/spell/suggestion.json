    "body": "<p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The <i>suggestion</i> must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. </p><p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p><p>A very reasonable <i>suggestion</i> causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as &ndash;1 or &ndash;2).</p>",
