    "body": "<p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the <i>symbol of sleep </i>instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 &times; 10 minutes. Unlike with the <i>sleep </i>spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.</p><p>Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of sleep </i>has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <i>symbol of sleep </i>simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Note</i>Magic traps such as <i>symbol of sleep </i>are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for <i>symbol of sleep</i>.</p>",
