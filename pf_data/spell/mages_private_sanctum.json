    "body": "<p>This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.</p><p>Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to <i>detect thoughts</i>. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a <i>sending </i>or <i>message </i>spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and his familiar.</p><p>The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.</p><p><i>Mage's private sanctum </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>",
