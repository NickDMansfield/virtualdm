    "body": "<p>A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by <i>faerie fire</i> take a &ndash;20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical <i>darkness</i> effect functions normally), <i>blur</i>, <i>displacement, invisibility</i>, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The <i>faerie fire</i> can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The <i>faerie fire</i> does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.</p>",
