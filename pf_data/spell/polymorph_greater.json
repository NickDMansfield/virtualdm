    "body": "<p>This spell functions as <i>polymorph</i> except that it allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as <i>beast shape IV</i>. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as <i>elemental body III</i>. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as <i>alter self</i>. If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as <i>plant shape II</i>. If the form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as <i>form of the dragon I</i>. The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.</p>",
