    "body": "<p>You don't so much cast a <i>miracle</i> as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.</p><p>A <i>miracle</i> can do any of the following things.</p><ul><li> Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower. </li><li> Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.</li><li> Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as <i>feeblemind</i> or <i>insanity</i>.</li><li> Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <i>miracle</i> costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <i>miracles</i> of this sort could include the following:</p><ul><li> Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</li><li> Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.</li><li> Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</li></ul><p>In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.</p><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a <i>miracle</i> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.</p>",
