    "body": "<p>You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider). The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below.</p><p>Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (&ldquo;Attack,&rdquo; &ldquo;Defend,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.</p>",
