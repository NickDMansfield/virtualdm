    "body": "<p>A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere functions as a <i>wall of force</i>, except that it can be negated by <i>dispel magic</i>. A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.</p>",
