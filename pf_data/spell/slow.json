    "body": "<p>An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A <i>slowed</i> creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.</p><p>Multiple <i>slow</i> effects don't stack. <i>Slow</i> counters and dispels <i>haste</i>.</p>",
