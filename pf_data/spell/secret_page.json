    "body": "<p><i>Secret page</i> alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. <i>Explosive runes</i> or <i>sepia snake sigil</i> can be cast upon the <i>secret page</i>.</p><p>A <i>comprehend languages</i> spell alone cannot reveal a <i>secret page</i>'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its <i>secret page</i> form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A <i>detect magic</i> spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. <i>True seeing</i> reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with <i>comprehend languages</i>. A <i>secret page</i> spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an <i>erase</i> spell.</p>",
