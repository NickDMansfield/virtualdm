    "body": "<p>Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a &ndash;4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.</p>",
