    "body": "<p id=\"armor-undead-controlling\"><i>Undead controlling armor</i> or <i>shields</i> often have skeletal or other grisly decorations or flourishes to their decor. They let the user control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the <i>control undead</i> spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.</p><p>Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>control undead</i>; Price +49,000 gp.</p>",
