    "body": "<p id=\"wounding\">A <i>wounding weapon</i> deals 1 point of bleed damage when it hits a creature. Multiple hits from a wounding weapon increase the bleed damage. Bleeding creatures take the bleed damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage. A critical hit does not multiply the bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the bleed damage dealt by this weapon.</p><p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>bleed</i>; Price +2 bonus.</p>",
