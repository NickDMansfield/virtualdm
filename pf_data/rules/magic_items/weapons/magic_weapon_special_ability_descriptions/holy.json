    "body": "<p id=\"weapons-holy\">A <i>holy weapon</i> is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by <i>restoration</i> spells) while the weapon is wielded.</p><p>Moderate evocation [good]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>holy smite</i>, creator must be good; Price +2 bonus.</p>",
