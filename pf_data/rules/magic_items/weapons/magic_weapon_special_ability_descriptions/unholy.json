    "body": "<p id=\"unholy\">An <i>unholy weapon</i> is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the weapon evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of good alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells) while the weapon is wielded.</p><p>Moderate evocation [evil]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>unholy blight</i>, creator must be evil; Price +2 bonus.</p>",
