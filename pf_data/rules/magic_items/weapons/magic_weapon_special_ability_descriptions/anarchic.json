    "body": "<p id=\"weapons-anarchic\">An <i>anarchic weapon</i> is infused with the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaotically aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of lawful alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells) while the weapon is wielded.</p><p>Moderate evocation [chaotic]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>chaos hammer</i>, creator must be chaotic; Price +2 bonus.</p>",
