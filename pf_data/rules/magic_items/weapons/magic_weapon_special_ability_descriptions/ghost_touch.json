    "body": "<p id=\"weapons-ghost-touch\">A <i>ghost touch weapon</i> deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. An incorporeal creature's 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to attacks made against it with <i>ghost touch weapons</i>. The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a <i>ghost touch weapon</i> counts as both corporeal or incorporeal.</p><p>Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>plane shift</i>; Price +1 bonus.</p>",
