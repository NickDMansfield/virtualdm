    "body": "<p>To create a magic rod, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a rod or the pieces of the rod to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the rod. Rod costs are difficult to determine. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the rod prices in the rod descriptions as a guideline. Creating a rod costs half the market value listed.</p><p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the rod, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require. The act of working on the rod triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the rod's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from the caster's currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p><p>Creating some rods may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p><p>Crafting a rod requires 1 day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p><p><b>Item Creation Feat Required</b>: Craft Rod.</p><p><b>Skill Used in Creation</b>: Spellcraft, Craft (jewelry), Craft (sculptures), or Craft (weapons).</p>",
