    "body": "<table id=\"extradimensional-spaces\"><caption>Extradimensional Spaces</caption>-<tr><td style=\"white-space:normal;\">A number of spells and magic items utilize extradimensional spaces, such as <i>rope trick</i>, a <i>bag of holding</i>, a <i>handy haversack</i>, and a <i>portable hole</i>. These spells and magic items create a tiny pocket space that does not exist in any dimension. Such items do not function, however, inside another extradimensional space. If placed inside such a space, they cease to function until removed from the extradimensional space. For example, if a <i>bag of holding</i> is brought into a<i> rope trick</i>, the contents of the <i>bag of holding</i> become inaccessible until the <i>bag of holding</i> is taken outside the <i>rope trick</i>. The only exception to this is when a<i> bag of holding</i> and a <i>portable hole</i> interact, forming a rift to the Astral Plane, as noted in their descriptions.</td></tr></table>",
