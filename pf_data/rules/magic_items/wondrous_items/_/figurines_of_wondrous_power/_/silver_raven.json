    "body": "<p id=\"silver-raven\">This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an <i>animal messenger</i> spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous. Moderate enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animal messenger, animate objects</i>.</p>",
