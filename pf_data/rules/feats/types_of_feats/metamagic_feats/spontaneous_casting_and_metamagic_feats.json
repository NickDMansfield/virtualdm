    "body": "<p>A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell, or a druid spontaneously casting a <i>summon nature's ally</i> spell, can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a standard action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast. The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell feat, which can be cast as a swift action.</p>",
