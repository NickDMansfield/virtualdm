    "body": "<p id=\"total-concealment\">If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight, he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can't attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with concealment).</p><p>You can't execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies.</p>",
