    "body": "<p id=\"coup-de-grace\">As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace (pronounced &ldquo;coo day grahs&rdquo;) to a helpless opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow, provided you are adjacent to the target. </p><p>You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when delivering a coup de grace.</p><p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.</p><p>You can't deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de grace against a creature with total concealment, but doing this requires two consecutive full-round actions (one to &ldquo;find&rdquo; the creature once you've determined what square it's in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).</p>",
