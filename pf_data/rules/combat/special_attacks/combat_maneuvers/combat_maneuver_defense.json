    "body": "<p id=\"combat-maneuver-defense\">Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Defense (or CMD) that represents its ability to resist combat maneuvers. A creature's CMD is determined using the following formula:</p><p><big><b>CMD = 10 + Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + Dexterity modifier + special size modifier</b></big></p><p>The special size modifier for a creature's Combat Maneuver Defense is as follows: Fine &ndash;8, Diminutive &ndash;4, Tiny &ndash;2, Small &ndash;1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8. Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMD when resisting specific maneuvers. A creature can also add any circumstance, deflection, dodge, insight, luck, morale, profane, and sacred bonuses to AC to its CMD. Any penalties to a creature's AC also apply to its CMD. A flat-footed creature does not add its Dexterity bonus to its CMD.</p>",
