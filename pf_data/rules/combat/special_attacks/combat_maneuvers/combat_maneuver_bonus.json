    "body": "<p id=\"combat-maneuver-bonus\">Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Bonus (or CMB) that represents its skill at performing combat maneuvers. A creature's CMB is determined using the following formula:</p><p><big><b>CMB = Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + special size modifier</b></big></p><p>Creatures that are size Tiny or smaller use their Dexterity modifier in place of their Strength modifier to determine their CMB. The special size modifier for a creature's Combat Maneuver Bonus is as follows: Fine &ndash;8, Diminutive &ndash;4, Tiny &ndash;2, Small &ndash;1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8. Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMB when performing specific maneuvers.</p>",
