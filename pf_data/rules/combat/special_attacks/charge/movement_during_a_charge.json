If you move a distance equal to your speed or less, you can also draw a weapon during a charge attack if your base attack bonus is at least +1.</p><p>You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). You must move to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can't charge. If any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you can't charge. Helpless creatures don't stop a charge.</p><p>If you don't have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can't charge that opponent.</p><p>You can't take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge.</p><p>If you are able to take only a standard action on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed) and you cannot draw a weapon unless you possess the Quick Draw feat. You can't use this option unless you are restricted to taking only a standard action on your turn.</p>",
