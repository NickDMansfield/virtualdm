    "body": "<p>If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. You suffer a &ndash;6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a &ndash;10 penalty to the attack with your off hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways. First, if your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light. Second, the Two-Weapon Fighting feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6.</p><p>Table: Two-weapon Fighting Penalties summarizes the interaction of all these factors.</p>",
