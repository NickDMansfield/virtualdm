You can only take a standard action or a move action in each round (in addition to free, immediate, and swift actions). You cease being staggered when your current hit points once again exceed your nonlethal damage.</p><p>When your nonlethal damage exceeds your current hit points, you fall unconscious. While unconscious, you are helpless.</p><p>Spellcasters who fall unconscious retain any spellcasting ability they had before going unconscious.</p><p>If a creature's nonlethal damage is equal to his total maximum hit points (not his current hit points), all further nonlethal damage is treated as lethal damage. This does not apply to creatures with regeneration. Such creatures simply accrue additional nonlethal damage, increasing the amount of time they remain unconscious.</p>",
