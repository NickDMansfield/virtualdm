If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point.

Such characters lose 1 hit point per round in addition to the continuous damage. </p><p>You can keep a dying character from losing any more hit points and make him stable with a DC 15 Heal check.</p><p>If any sort of healing cures the dying character of even 1 point of damage, he becomes stable and stops losing hit points.</p><p>Healing that raises the dying character's hit points to 0 makes him conscious and disabled. Healing that raises his hit points to 1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he'd never been reduced to 0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0 hit points.</p><p>A stable character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically healed eventually regains consciousness and recovers hit points naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his life is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.</p>",

Treat such characters as those attempting to recover with help, but every failed Constitution check to regain consciousness results in the loss of 1 hit point.

Once conscious, the character can make a DC 10 Constitution check once per day, after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering hit points naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become unconscious.
