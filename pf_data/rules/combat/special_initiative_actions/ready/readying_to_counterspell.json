    "body": "<p>You may ready a counterspell against a spellcaster (often with the trigger &ldquo;if she starts casting a spell&rdquo;). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (and are able to cast it and have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as a counterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster's spell. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.</p><p>A spellcaster can use <i>dispel magic</i> to counterspell another spellcaster, but it doesn't always work.</p>",
