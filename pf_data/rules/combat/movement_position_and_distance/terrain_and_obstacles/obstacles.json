    "body": "<p>Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn't completely block it, each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the obstacle, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don't have sufficient movement to cross the obstacle and move into the square on the other side, you can't cross it. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.</p><p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can't move through a blocking obstacle.</p><p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are able to avoid most obstacles.</p>",
