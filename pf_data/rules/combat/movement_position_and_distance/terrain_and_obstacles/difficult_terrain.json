Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares. You can't run or charge across difficult terrain.</p><p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p><p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p>",
