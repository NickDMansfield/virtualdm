    "body": "<p id=\"squeezing\">In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn't as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty to AC.</p><p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up 4 squares) squeezes into a space that's 1 square wide, the creature's miniature figure occupies 2 squares, centered on the line between the 2 squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p><p>A creature can squeeze past a creature while moving but it can't end its movement in an occupied square.</p><p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space's width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can't attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>",
