See Table: Actions in Combat for a list of full-round actions.</p><p>Some full-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.</p><p>Some full-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only in situations when you are limited to performing only a standard action during your round. The descriptions of specific actions detail which actions allow this option.</p>",
