    "body": "<p>You can move 5 feet in any round when you don't perform any other kind of movement. Taking this 5-foot step never provokes an attack of opportunity. You can't take more than one 5-foot step in a round, and you can't take a 5-foot step in the same round that you move any distance.</p><p>You can take a 5-foot step before, during, or after your other actions in the round. </p><p>You can only take a 5-foot-step if your movement isn't hampered by difficult terrain or darkness. Any creature with a speed of 5 feet or less can't take a 5-foot step, since moving even 5 feet requires a move action for such a slow creature.</p><p>You may not take a 5-foot step using a form of movement for which you do not have a listed speed. </p>",
