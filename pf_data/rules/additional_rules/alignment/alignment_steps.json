In this case, &ldquo;steps&rdquo; refers to the number of alignment shifts between the two alignments, as shown on the following diagram. Note that diagonal &ldquo;steps&rdquo; count as two steps. For example, a lawful neutral character is one step away from a lawful good alignment, and three steps away from a chaotic evil alignment. A cleric's alignment must be within one step of the alignment of her deity. </p>",
