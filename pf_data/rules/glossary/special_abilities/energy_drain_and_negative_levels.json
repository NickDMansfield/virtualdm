    "body": "<p>Some spells and a number of undead creatures have the ability to drain away life and energy; this dreadful attack results in &ldquo;negative levels.&rdquo; These cause a character to take a number of penalties.</p><p>For each negative level a creature has, it takes a cumulative &ndash;1 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, Combat Maneuver Defense, saving throws, and skill checks. In addition, the creature reduces its current and total hit points by 5 for each negative level it possesses. The creature is also treated as one level lower for the purpose of level-dependent variables (such as spellcasting) for each negative level possessed. Spellcasters do not lose any prepared spells or slots as a result of negative levels. If a creature's negative levels equal or exceed its total Hit Dice, it dies.</p><p>A creature with temporary negative levels receives a new saving throw to remove the negative level each day. The DC of this save is the same as the effect that caused the negative levels.</p><p>Some abilities and spells (such as <i>raise dead</i>) bestow permanent level drain on a creature. These are treated just like temporary negative levels, but they do not allow a new save each day to remove them. Level drain can be removed through spells like <i>restoration</i>. Permanent negative levels remain after a dead creature is restored to life. A creature whose permanent negative levels equal its Hit Dice cannot be brought back to life through spells like <i>raise dead</i> and <i>resurrection</i> without also receiving a <i>restoration</i> spell, cast the round after it is restored to life.</p>",
