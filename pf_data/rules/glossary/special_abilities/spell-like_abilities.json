    "body": "<p id=\"spell-like-abilities-sp\">Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are magical abilities that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and <i>dispel magic</i>. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an <i>antimagic field</i>). Spell-like abilities can be dispelled but they cannot be counterspelled or used to counterspell.</p>",
