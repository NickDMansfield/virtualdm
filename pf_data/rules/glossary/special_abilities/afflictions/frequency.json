    "body": "<p>This is how often the periodic saving throw must be attempted after the affliction has been contracted (after the onset time, if the affliction has any). While some afflictions last until they are cured, others end prematurely, even if the character is not cured through other means. If an affliction ends after a set amount of time, it will be noted in the frequency. For example, a disease with a frequency of &ldquo;1/day&rdquo; lasts until cured, but a poison with a frequency of &ldquo;1/round for 6 rounds&rdquo; ends after 6 rounds have passed.</p><p>Afflictions without a frequency occur only once, immediately upon contraction (or after the onset time if one is listed). </p>",
