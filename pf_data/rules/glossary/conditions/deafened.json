He takes a &ndash;4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails Perception checks based on sound, takes a &ndash;4 penalty on opposed Perception checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.</p>",
