    "body": "<p id=\"shadow-plane\">The eerie and deadly Shadow Plane is a grim, colorless &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; of the Material Plane. It overlaps with the Material Plane but is smaller in size, and is in many ways a warped and mocking &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; of the Material Plane, one infused with negative energy (see Inner Planes) and serving as home for strange monsters like undead shadows and worse. Powerful spellcasters utilize the Shadow Plane to swiftly travel immense distances on the Material Plane with <i>shadow walk</i>, or draw upon the mutable essence of the Shadow Plane to create quasi-real effects and creatures with spells like <i>shadow evocation</i> or <i>shades</i>.</p>",
