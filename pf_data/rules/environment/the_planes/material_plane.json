The &ldquo;size&rdquo; of the Material Plane depends upon the campaign&mdash;it might conform only to the single world on which your game is set, or it might encompass an entire universe of planets, moons, stars, and galaxies. The Material Plane is the default plane for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>",
