These traps deal the same damage as the melee weapons they &ldquo;wield.&rdquo; In the case of a falling stone block, you can assign any amount of bludgeoning damage you like, but remember that whoever resets the trap has to lift that stone back into place. </p><p>A melee attack trap can be constructed with a built-in bonus on damage rolls, just as if the trap itself had a high Strength score.</p>",
