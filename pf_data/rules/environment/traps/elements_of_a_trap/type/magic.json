Unless the spell or item description states otherwise, assume the following to be true.</p><ul><li> A successful Perception check (DC 25 + spell level) detects a magic trap before it goes off. </li><li> Magic traps permit a saving throw in order to avoid the effect (DC 10 + spell level &times; 1.5).</li><li> Magic traps may be disarmed by a character with the trapfinding class feature with a successful Disable Device skill check (DC 25 + spell level). Other characters have no chance to disarm a magic trap with a Disable Device check.</li></ul><p>Magic traps are further divided into spell traps and magic device traps. Magic device traps initiate spell effects when activated, just as wands, rods, rings, and other magic items do. Creating a magic device trap requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat.</p><p>Spell traps are simply spells that themselves function as traps. Creating a spell trap requires the services of a character who can cast the needed spell or spells, who is usually either the character creating the trap or an NPC spellcaster hired for that purpose. </p>",
