    "body": "<p>This trigger activates the trap when a creature approaches within a certain distance of it. A proximity trigger differs from a location trigger in that the creature need not be standing in a particular square. Creatures that are flying can spring a trap with a proximity trigger but not one with a location trigger. Mechanical proximity triggers are extremely sensitive to the slightest change in the air. This makes them useful only in places such as crypts, where the air is unusually still.</p><p>The proximity trigger used most often for magic device traps is the <i>alarm</i> spell. Unlike when the spell is cast, an <i>alarm</i> spell used as a trigger can have an area that's no larger than the area the trap is meant to protect.</p><p>Some magic device traps have special proximity triggers that activate only when certain kinds of creatures approach. For example, a <i>detect good</i> spell can serve as a proximity trigger on an evil altar, springing the attached trap only when someone of good alignment gets close enough to it.</p>",
