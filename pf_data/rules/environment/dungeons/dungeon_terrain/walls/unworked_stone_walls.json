    "body": "<p>These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are smooth to the touch but filled with tiny holes, hidden alcoves, and ledges at various heights. They're also usually wet or at least damp, since it's water that most frequently creates natural caves. When such a wall has an &ldquo;other side,&rdquo; the wall is usually at least 5 feet thick. It takes a DC 15 Climb check to move along an unworked stone wall. </p>",
