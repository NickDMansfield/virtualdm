It might be protected from harm, increasing its hardness or giving it more hit points as well as an improved saving throw bonus against <i>disintegrate</i> and similar spells. A magic door might not lead into the space behind it, but instead might be a portal to a faraway place or even another plane of existence. Other magic doors might require passwords or special keys to open them. </p>",
