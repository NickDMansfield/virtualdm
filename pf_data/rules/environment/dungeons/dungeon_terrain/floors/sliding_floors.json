    "body": "<p>A sliding floor is a type of trap door, designed to be moved and thus reveal something that lies beneath it. A typical sliding floor moves so slowly that anyone standing on one can avoid falling into the gap it creates, assuming there's somewhere else to go. If such a floor slides quickly enough that there's a chance of a character falling into whatever lies beneath&mdash;a spiked pit, a vat of burning oil, or a pool filled with sharks&mdash;then it's a trap.</p>",
