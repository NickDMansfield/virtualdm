If a character takes a standard or full-round action, the remaining duration that the character can hold her breath is reduced by 1 round. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round in order to continue holding her breath. Each round, the DC increases by 1. </p><p>When the character finally fails her Constitution check, she begins to drown. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hp). In the following round, she drops to &ndash;1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, she drowns.</p><p>Unconscious characters must begin making Constitution checks immediately upon being submerged (or upon becoming unconscious if the character was conscious when submerged). Once she fails one of these checks, she immediately drops to &ndash;1 (or loses 1 additional hit point, if her total is below &ndash;1). On the following round, she drowns.</p><p>It is possible to drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand, fine dust, and silos full of grain.</p>",
