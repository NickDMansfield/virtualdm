    "body": "<p>Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep, have improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) from opponents on land. Land-bound opponents who have <i>freedom of movement</i> effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has total cover against opponents on land unless those opponents have <i>freedom of movement</i> effects. Magical effects are unaffected except for those that require attack rolls (which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.</p>",
