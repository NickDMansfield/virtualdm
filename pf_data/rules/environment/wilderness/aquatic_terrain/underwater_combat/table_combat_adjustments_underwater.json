An off-balance creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on attacks against it. </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">2 A creature without <i>freedom of movement</i> effects or a swim speed makes grapple checks underwater at a &ndash;2 penalty, but deals damage normally when grappling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">3 A successful Swim check lets a creature move one-quarter its speed as a move action or one-half its speed as a full-round action.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">4 Creatures have firm footing when walking along the bottom, braced against a ship's hull, or the like. A creature can only walk along the bottom if it wears or carries enough gear to weigh itself down: at least 16 pounds for Medium creatures, twice that for each size category larger than Medium, and half that for each size category smaller than Medium. </td></tr></tfoot></table>",
