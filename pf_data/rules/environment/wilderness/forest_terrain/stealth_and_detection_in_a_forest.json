In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8 &times; 10 feet, and in a dense forest it is 2d6 &times; 10 feet.</p><p>Because any square with undergrowth provides concealment, it's usually easy for a creature to use the Stealth skill in the forest. Logs and massive trees provide cover, which also makes hiding possible.</p><p>The background noise in the forest makes Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, increasing the DC of the check by 2 per 10 feet, not 1. </p>",
