    "body": "<p>Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to extreme heat (see Heat Dangers). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of fire damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the lethal damage, but not the nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a &ndash;4 penalty on their saving throws. Those wearing metal armor or who come into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a <i>heat metal</i> spell.</p>",
