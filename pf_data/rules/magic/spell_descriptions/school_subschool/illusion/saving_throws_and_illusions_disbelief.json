    "body": "<p>Creatures encountering an illusion usually do not receive saving throws to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.</p><p>A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.</p><p>A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to notice something is amiss. A character faced with proof that an illusion isn't real needs no saving throw. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates this fact to others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.</p>",
