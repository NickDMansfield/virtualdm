    "body": "<p id=\"verbal\">A verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you must be able to speak in a strong voice. A <i>silence</i> spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance of spoiling any spell with a verbal component that he tries to cast.</p>",
