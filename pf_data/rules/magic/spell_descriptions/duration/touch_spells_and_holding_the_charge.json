You can make touch attacks round after round until the spell is discharged. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.</p><p>Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can't hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</p>",
