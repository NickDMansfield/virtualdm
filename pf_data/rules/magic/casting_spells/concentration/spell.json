If the spell affecting you deals damage, the DC is 10 + the damage taken + the level of the spell you're casting.</p><p>If the spell interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the DC is the spell's saving throw DC + the level of the spell you're casting. For a spell with no saving throw, it's the DC that the spell's saving throw would have if a save were allowed (10 + spell level + caster's ability score).</p>",
