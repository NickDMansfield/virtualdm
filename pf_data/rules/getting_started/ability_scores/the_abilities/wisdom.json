    "body": "<p>Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score. A character with a Wisdom score of 0 is incapable of rational thought and is unconscious.</p><p>You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:</p><ul><li> Will saving throws (for negating the effects of <i>charm person</i> and other spells).</li><li> Heal, Perception, Profession, Sense Motive, and Survival checks.</li></ul><p>Clerics, druids, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>",
