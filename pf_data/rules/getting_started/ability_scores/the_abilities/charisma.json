    "body": "<p>Charisma measures a character's personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to channel energy. For undead creatures, Charisma is a measure of their unnatural &ldquo;lifeforce.&rdquo; Every creature has a Charisma score. A character with a Charisma score of 0 is not able to exert himself in any way and is unconscious.</p><p>You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:</p><ul><li> Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks.</li><li> Checks that represent attempts to influence others. </li><li> Channel energy DCs for clerics and paladins attempting to harm undead foes.</li></ul><p>Bards, paladins, and sorcerers gain a number of bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a bard, paladin, or sorcerer spell is 10 + the spell's level.</p>",
