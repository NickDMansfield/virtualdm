Creatures of animal-level instinct have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2. Any creature capable of understanding speech has a score of at least 3. A character with an Intelligence score of 0 is comatose. Some creatures do not possess an Intelligence score. Their modifier is +0 for any Intelligence-based skills or checks.</p><p>You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:</p><ul><li> The number of bonus languages your character knows at the start of the game. These are in addition to any starting racial languages and Common. If you have a penalty, you can still read and speak your racial languages unless your Intelligence is lower than 3.</li><li> The number of skill points gained each level, though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.</li><li> Appraise, Craft, Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks.</li></ul><p>A wizard gains bonus spells based on his Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level. </p>",
