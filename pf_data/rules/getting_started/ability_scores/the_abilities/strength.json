    "body": "<p>Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or &ldquo;melee&rdquo;) combat, such as fighters, monks, paladins, and some rangers. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry. A character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious. Some creatures do not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at all to Strength-based skills or checks.</p><p>You apply your character's Strength modifier to:</p><ul><li> Melee attack rolls.</li><li> Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon, including a sling. (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive 1&ndash;1/2 times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)</li><li> Climb and Swim checks.</li><li> Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).</li></ul>",
